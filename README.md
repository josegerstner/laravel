### Use of console  

Global install :   
```  
composer global require "laravel/installer"
```  
  
New project :  
```  
laravel new project  
cd project  
php artisan serve  
```  
*project is our project name*.  
  
Open Browser and **localhost:8000**. If you can see the Laravel page works, you works!
